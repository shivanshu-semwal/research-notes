# Title

One of significant pieces of a research paper.

How to select a title.

- Don't choose a broad topic.
    - For e.g. "e-agriculture in Artificial Intelligence"
    this is a broad topic and will require huge effort and more than a year of time.
- Every word in the title is significant, they are treated as keywords for your research paper.
- Reviewing the title in a feedback loop. Title of research will evolve during th research.
    - Start with a title and do some research.
    - See if the title aligns with what you are researching,
      if not change the title.
    - Title of research will keep on changing as you find new
      material on what you are researching.
- Add on to the previous research for your topic.
  Saying previously said thing in new words will not be considered as research.
- Clear, concise, catchy, informative, specific as opposed to a broad one.
