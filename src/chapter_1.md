## Introduction

Research is searching about a topic repeatedly ("re"), and then present you findings in form of a technical report. This technical report must have some standards:

- It should give some results.
- The origin of data used in the research must be mentioned.
- The experimentation procedures used while conducting research should be mentioned.
- It should clearly mention
    - How you framed the problem?
    - Why you choose a solution?
    - Are there any other solutions?
    - If no, your solution is novel one, and should be mentioned in the title.
    - If yes then
        - Review other solution and list what was problem with other solutions.
        - Mention how you solution is better than the previous ones.

## Steps in conducting research

- Identification of research problem
- Literature review
- Specifying the purpose of research
- Determining specific research questions
- Specification of a conceptual framework, sometimes including a set of hypotheses
- Choice of a methodology (for data collection)
- Data collection
- Verifying data
- Analyzing and interpreting the data
- Reporting and evaluating research
- Communicating the research findings and, possibly, recommendations

## Research Methods

- Exploratory research, which helps to identify and define a problem or question.
- Constructive research, which tests theories and proposes solutions to a problem or question.
- Empirical research, which tests the feasibility of a solution using empirical evidence.

## Publishing

Academic publishing is a system that is necessary for academic scholars to peer review the work and make it available for a wider audience.

When you submit your research paper for peer review, several possible outcomes may occur:

- Acceptance: If the paper meets the journal's standards for originality, relevance, and quality, it may be accepted for publication.
- Rejection: If the paper is found to be unsuitable for publication, it may be rejected by the journal.
- Acceptance with review: Sometimes, a paper may be accepted conditionally pending revisions based on feedback from the reviewers. In such cases, the authors will receive a set of comments and suggestions to address, and they will need to submit a revised version of the paper for further review.
- Reconsideration after review: After incorporating the suggested revisions, the paper will be reevaluated by the reviewers to determine if it meets the journal's requirements for publication. Based on this reevaluation, it may be accepted, rejected, or accepted with further revisions required.
