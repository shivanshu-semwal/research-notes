# How to write a Research Paper

Writing is also done in iterations.
First start with a title.
Search for the related works and background.
After reading you may want to change the title based on the new knowledge
you have gained by reading other works.
After this you ask some questions or propose some hypothesis
which you are going to use in your research.
After this list the sections. Write the sections and do the research and work necessary.
Write conclusion.
Now go through another iteration.
Note that this entire process is based on feedback and
anything can be changed when new information is added.
